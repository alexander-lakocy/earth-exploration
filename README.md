# README

This is the README for the `earth-exploration` repository.

Included with this repository is the `asf_analysis` package, which contains classes designed for working with
[Alaska Satellite Facility](https://asf.alaska.edu/) data downloaded using the 
[`asf_search`](https://docs.asf.alaska.edu/asf_search/basics/) python package or 
ASF's [Vertex](https://search.asf.alaska.edu/) platform.

This is a very early exploration package built for personal/hobby use. It should not be considered stable and is not
versioned.
